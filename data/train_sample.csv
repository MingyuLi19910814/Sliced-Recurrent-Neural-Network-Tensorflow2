5,"gute lage im stadtzentrum. shoppingmeile und sehensw  rdigkeiten, sowie gute pubs in laufweite. das hotel ist neu, gut gepflegt und hat bem  htes nettes personal. ideal f  r einen kurztrip nach edinburgh. l  ngere aufenthalte eher nicht, da die zimmer recht klein sind."
4,"this is a fairly new property i think. it is a german company and has most of the amenities you would want. it is priced on the budget minded side so it won't break your bank.
location is really good. near the royal mile and waverley station without being too noisy. very easy to walk to everything we wanted to do. has wifi but we did have to re log in every day."
4,"first time at this group of hotels. pretty new, only one in uk, another to open in edinburgh and one in london. rooms not very big but great price and location for a weekend in edinburgh. rooms clean, comfortable, good shower and free wifi!"
3,"had continental style breakfast here a short distance from waverley station as i had half hour before a train home and wanted to try somewhere new. motel1one is nearby and a easy two minute walk, slightly uphill towards the castle from the station. 

on entry it's modern, cosy has tons of cool yet bright pastel and mochilato colours to accommodate your cold wintertime self. wooden floors, warm rugs, sheepskins on the sofas, slate walls and oak barrelled tables, with slight distinct scottish themes due to their tartan furnished accessories completes the feel.

i sat in one lounge, had tea and food self served for well under   10, you know bran, meats cheese and croissant that sort of stuff. with a copy of local newspaper in hand i really needed to eat, stay warm and access wifi, the reasons i came in.

some hotels in the city give you access to wifi if your a paying guest, but repeated attempts to access their wifi even with staff help, eventually gave access but in german. on going to reception again for additional help the staff were great got the correct website for me, but still no luck.

hmmm, by the time this was all done i came back to cold tea and didn't really have time now to finish a second cup of hot earl grey, so sorry to staff for removing an almost full cup of tea. great place though nice breakfast and funky decor especially the plasma tv displaying a roasting log fire in reception, but sadly for me no easy access to wifi when badly required.

maybe next time i will endeavour to try food against technology!"
2,"definitely not a fan. coming from orange county, ca, i have high expectations when it comes to asian food.  suffice to say that panda express would have been a better choice, which is pretty sad."
4,the food was fantastic! i highly recommend  the lettuce wraps.
2,"took the family there last week.  ordered fried wontons, sweet and sour beef, mongolian beef, honey crusted chicken and pad thai noodles.  

the mongolian beef was delicious, however the white rice was undercooked, some of the rice was hard still and crunchy.

honey crusted chicken also quite good, same story with the rice.  same thing with the sweet and sour beef.

ordered the pad thai without peanuts... son is allergic to peanuts so we made it very clear we didn't want anything with nuts.  they deliver the pad thai with peanuts all over the top.  sent it back and they fixed it.

they brought us spring rolls which we did not order.  we said they were not ours we ordered wontons.  they bring us the wontons a few minutes later.  the wontons are less expensive than the spring rolls, we point that our to the guy at the register and with a bit of smart alecky ness says that he ""let us keep the spring rolls"" and ""didn't charge is for all of our drinks"" as if he did us a favor.

overall the food was decent, the rice was terrible and the attitude of the cashier was not what i expected with a  65 food order!!

i wouldn't go back for that price and food quality but perhaps we caught them on a bad day.."
4,i love the lettuce wraps here. they are simply the best.  i order carry out often from here. i occasionally dine in.  my problem with the dinning in is the seating. it is always difficult to find a seat.  the place really needs to expand.  if you have a party of more than 4 most days you can hang it up.  other than the seating i like it. large portions of rice and noodles.  a little stingy on the meat.
4,i've been here at least 5 times now and each time is better than the last. i iove what they have done to improve the building and add outdoor dining. service is always good here and on par with other top places in mentor. i really suggest the chicken soup on a cold day it's very yummy! everything i've had on the menu has been great.
5,"i eat here all the time and most of the staff are from guadalajara.... food is definately ""americanized"" and by that i mean tamed down in heat and changed a little for what americans expect.... but when i order my racos de carne asada with lime and cilantro and onions.... all i get are big smiles and hot sauce.... so if your in the mood for authentic hotmexican food.... just let the waiter know.. hell guide you to a great choice!"
5,what a surprise!  the most amazing mexican food i have ever tasted and i am a foodie. my husband and i ordered the table side guac.  delicious!   texas margaritas. delicious!  seafood burritos with fresh cilantro!  i will be salivating for them soon!  all of the food was so fresh!  you must try this place. we will try the green road location next as it is closer to our home.
5,"yum!!! i love this place! come almost every friday. try the chicken chili verde, my first favorite dish. my new favorite, burrito chipotle!!!! so delicious! don't forget the margaritas!!  )"
2,"i don't understand all of the high marks for the this place. the chips were not good and the salsa wasn't good either.. the chips were bland, old and not seasoned at all, the salsa represented canned tomato taste, yuk, the chix enchilada was flavorless, while using white meat chicken it was not seasoned and very chewy, it had no flavor whatsoever and was definitely something ""not"" to order. the  most off putting thing about the place is the filthiness of all the furniture and the fact that we had fruit flies buzzing our table thru out our meal. while el rodeo and el patron are nearby, and have far better food,i cant understand what the attraction is to this place, will not be back"
5,"love this place. i went there with me boyfriend to celebrate our anniversary and i am glad my colleagues suggested me this place. the food is really really good. they have a great cocktail list. 

we shared the hot balls (delicious) and the rillettes (i loved it). then, i had the beef tartare with the side of potatoes cooked in duck fat (awesome). to finish, i had the lemon pannacotta...this is by far one of the best dessert i've tried. i am not a dessert person and not a big fan of lemon but that dessert was just perfect!! 

the service was slow so don't go there if you are in a rush! our waiter was really nice  and even tried to speak in french as he noticed that we were speaking french. 

i will definitely go back there...i am sad this place is kind of far from were i live!"
5,"had a lovely evening last night at table 17.  great selection of wine and the owner made an excellent suggestion of something we had never heard of before   bearing in mind both price point, meal choices and preferences (though overall it was a bit of a pricey list, only one bottle south of  50, just).  

lovely, vibrant atmosphere, the polenta was delicious as a starter (the chef tops it with a different finish every day   last night it was meatballs)   though the other ones we saw at other tables also looked sumptuous   and our meals sides were excellent.  also, the food prices

all in all a great evening    could have happily ordered anything from the menu, and what we did order was delish.   

definitely will go back to work our way through the rest of the menu."
4,"found this place by chance and walked in for brunch on a sunday. there was one table available luckily. there wasn't a lot on the menu, but all the items we ordered wew so fabulous!! and very out of the ordinary. service was good too.

french toast with creme anglais, pastry shell with onions, pears etc... all fabulous. it's a delight for the senses, this place."
4,"i had a nice time at table 17.

it was busy when we got there. we had reservations but had to wait at the bar (no big deal) and the bartender (he's in his early 100s) was a riot.

i had the polenta to start. it was creamy and buttery, and the braised pork shoulder in white wine on top was oh so good.

i had the short ribs as my main. the meat was tender and moist and the root veggies were perfectly cooked.

we shared the hunters mash as a side   i was expecting more flavour.

table 17 had a great vibe to it.
the food was good. the servers were attentive. i'd definitely go back."
2,"i was very excited to try table 17, and unfortunately it was a huge let down. i was made to feel very uncomfortable from the moment that i walked in. it was terrible service, and i was very surprised to see this. the waitress asked us to order our appetizer and entree at the same time, causing us to feel very rushed. we waited about an hour for our dinner and were quite disinterested when the food even came.  the beef tartar was by far my best course. the scallops were fine, as to be expected. the broccoli was good once you were able to get past that it was cold. wine list by the glass was limited, and we never heard of any specials for the evening. we did receive bread with oil prior to the meal, but no extra plate to put the oil on. we had to get up ourselves and go to the bread table for a plate, balsamic vinegar, salt and pepper. an all around let down for a place that i had heard was good."
2,"considering the amount of rave reviews on here, i suggested our group of five celebrate a birthday at table 17. maybe it was an off night but i walked away with a bad first impression. so did my guests.

the dinner reservation was at 5 45 on a saturday, so it wasn't like it was packed. still took close to 40 mins until our cocktails arrived. 

our server was very pleasant but the service steadily declined over the course of our 3 hour (!!!) meal. scatterbrained service, slow bartender and even slower kitchen. it was clear the kitchen and bar were completely backed up. 

our table was finished our bottle of wine before our mains arrived so i ordered another glass of wine so i could enjoy some with dinner. that glass arrived 20 mins after i was finished my main. lots of apologies but little else.

that being said, the cocktails, hot balls and panna cotta were outstanding. and the space is gorgeous. however, our mains were overpriced and overcooked. we all cleaned our plates because we were starving (almost 2 hours to receive mains), but they just weren't great. the halibut was the best of the bunch.

considering the amount of solid restaurants in this city, i won't visit again."
5,"had a very lovely meal here on saturday. came at 6 30 and it wasn't busy but filled up by the time we left. the crowd was definitely older, i don't think i saw anyone under 30 in there. decor was very woodsy and rustic. but at the end of the day, it's the food that counts!
we had...
hot balls  lamb risotto, mushroom and fontina risotto, and a goat cheese and honey balls. you get three little timbit sized balls for 7 bucks which i thought was very reasonable. they were so delicious, i wished we had gotten the double portion after we were finished.
polenta w  sausage sugo  my affection for polenta knows no bounds so i loved every little spoonful of this. it came out on a slice of a tree trunk which allowed the polenta to slowly spread out perfectly over the dish. polenta was creamy and had a nice umami flavour. good liquid to polenta ratio made this comforting and incredibly addictive. chef came out and laid the hot sausage meat sauce right on top of it. we loved it so much, we made it at home the next day...seriously.
steak tartare w  frites and salad  delish and flavourful tartare. the frites were incredible!! get them!

will i be back? yes! none of the dishes even remotely disappointed me and the service was solid."
4,"the first time i came to table 17 was a little over a year ago. i took my grandmother and my aunt out for dinner. the moment i came to this place i was very impressed. 

firstly, it was very conveniently located to us. secondly, it has this very home y feel and decor. nothing felt overwhelming. we came on a monday night. (to my knowledge sunday and monday nights table17 offers prix fixe menu.) we all ordered different staters, steak and different desserts! however, what made me fall in love with this place is thee amazing home made olive oil. their olive oil tasted amazingly fresh and you can't help but eat all of their fresh bread with it. unfortunately, in multiple occasions i've asked if i could purchase a bottle and to my disappointment they do not sell their olive oil.  ( 

the only thing i found about this place that did not satisfy my expectations were tht the servers are very slow and not as hospitable as other servers from my other experiences. 

overall, i definitely recommend this place. especially their duck confit which is amazing! 

 cl 

ps they take reservations and it gets pretty busy so be sure to make them.  )"
4,"had dinner here once and it was ok, but the brunch was great. i had the sloppy giuseppe   two sunny side eggs top a crispy, fried polenta cake, surrounded by a moat of bolognese sauce. awesome. i'll definitely be back for that alone."
4,"brunchy time and we have a winner.  to start, we got a seat right away on sunday for brunch.  i highly suggest going around 11 30 as you just miss the 12pm rush.  it is a stylish restaurant and the service was top notch.

for my meal, i had the french toast.  it was good   light and perfectly cooked.  the cinnamon anglaise tasted like melted ice cream.  there was an assortment of berries as well.  their orange juice was freshly squeezed and we were in and out in under 45 minutes. 

definitely will be back for another brunch extrodinaire!"
5,"we really enjoyed this place.  food and service was excellent.  table 17 has different and unique things to try! i highly recommend the goat cheese balls, they were fantastic!!"
4,"pei oysters with the lime tequila sauce were great.  the menu on the website was out of date, so the bearnaise i was expecting to have with my steak frites was not available. however, the chimichurri sauce that replaced it was very good."
4,"rarely do i ever venture east of yonge. it terrifies me. but when my bff requested we go to table 17 for her birthday, i put on my big girl pants and made my way to the east. walking along queen, east of broadview, i was amazed at how much has changed (i lived on broadview and dundas years ago and this was not the place to be). 

once we arrived at table 17 i was really impressed with the overall vibe. warm, inviting, with minimal segregation from the kitchen to the dining area (i love seeing who's making my meal!). 

i had oysters to start and the beef tartare for my main. it was chalked full of flavour. everyone else at the table really enjoyed their dishes as well (some fish, some pasta... no weak meal was served). 

the server was wonderful. he had a great balance of being helpful and present at times and then absent when he wasn't needed. 

great venue... worth making the trek across the yonge street tracks."
5,"the fish croquette, pork belly and collard greens price fixe for  35 were to die for. uncorking two bottles of chateauneuf du pape for free was simply priceless.  i am just not used to actually getting such value for money at restaurants in toronto."
4,"table 17 is a truly awesome restaurant and worth a visit. my girlfriend and i stumbled across it for brunch one weekend and were impressed. we then returned for sunday dinner and realized they have no corkage fees that evening, what a nice surprise.

the people running this restaurant get it, down to every detail. the servers are very friendly and helpful. the decor is nice, nothing overdone, just comfortable and 'rustic chic' which fits the type of place they are and food they serve. 

speaking of food, it's the best part. i don't have a high end palate, but i can say that i enjoyed every dish and felt the pricing was fair. servings were generous so you won't come away hungry. 

bravo guys. bra vo."
3,taste good but bad value. portions are way too small. we both had a app main and desert and still very hungry.
2,"meh. service was bad and food wasn't much better. the restaurant was clearly understaffed and our server rushed us all night.

to be fair, the hot balls and kale salad were very good appetizers. the main course was a huge disappointment. my fianc   ordered the trout on a recommendation from our server. it was bland and undercooked. the avocado mousse tasted processed and fake. i ordered the simcoe county pork chop after our server highly recommended it over the steak frites. super bland, no spices. 

maybe it was an off night as there seem to be mostly positive reviews, but we left disappointed."
5,"i had a groupon certificate for table 17 and i'm not usually one to purchase groupons unless it's a place i really want to try or already like, we walked in without reservations, which i am also not prone to doing, but they had a small table available that was out of the way and quiet.

i've heard others complain about the service here. i found it to be fabulous, and i'm in the industry myself, so i know what the job entails. our server explained the specials and gave us some great recommendations for drinks and menu items.

the hot balls (arroncini) were fabulous and small enough to add on to any meal without spoiling your appetite. lamb leg and merguez sausage wad fabulous and surprisingly lean.

desserts looked fab, although we were too full, but i loved that the cheese platter was priced with a glass of tawny port. delicious.

overall, a great dining experience and will be back for sure!!!

p.s. when you use a groupon, please please please remember to tip on the amount before discount. your server worked just as hard as he or she would for any other patron and it's in very bad taste to not acknowledge this."
4,"i've been to table 17 twice, and since the first time i came here, i have been anticipating the next time i would reunite with the sticky toffee bread pudding!
with a groupon in my hand and the final days ticking before expiration, i knew i had to get in here for what i hoped to be a fantastic dinner.

the tables were a little bit close, but not intruding and the waiter was patient and informative with the questions i had (i always have questions!)

for our shared appie, we went with the burrata because i have been looking for a good burrata dish since i moved back to to and had not found it yet.  i tried one at reds last year and thought that it was not creamy enough and unfortunately, this one missed the mark as well. i thought that there was not mixture between the mozza and cream, so the soft texture of the burrata was lacking. the flavours and other components of the dish paired very well.. just wish there was more creamy goodness.

it happened to be good friday and i really did not plan to eat meat that night. i was tempted to go with the shortribs because i knew i would not be disappointed from my first experience. i was debating between the pasta and one of the fish dishes but there was one component of each dish that did not speak to me.

on a whim, i went with the scallops at the very last second. it came in a creamy broth (was not a fan at first read) but it had been quite some time since i had some good scallops and i definitely had set some high expectations. on first bite..... i was grinning ear to ear... the scallops were perfectly cooked, loads of flavour in the broth, and i could not get enough. i'm just not a super big fan of clams, so i cannot really comment on them. none the less, i tried to scoop up ever last ounce of the broth on the plate! the short ribs were tender (husband's review), and very tasty.

for dessert .... i did not have to look at the menu   sticky toffee pudding it is.... it came out hot in a ramekin, loaded with caramel sauce and apple butter on the side. rich, decadent, tasty, mouth watering..... it was just like i remembered and more! s had the banana cheesecake, which i was hesitant about because i'm not sure how that could go well together... but it was actually surprisingly subtle but evident in banana flavour. with a touch of peanut butter to finish it off, the dessert was a great choice.

i'm so glad that my second experience was just as good as the first. as someone who doesn't repeat restaurants often, i can vouch that this one will not disappoint."
2,"i wanted to go to table 17 since i moved down to leslieville and was excited to finally find an opportunity to go. my party of 2 got there around 9 pm and waited about 10 minutes to be seated. unfortunately that's how the night continued. the decor is nice but very loud, with a large table in the middle of the main dining room for the servers to cut bread which we didn't receive until about 20 minutes after we were seated. we ordered drinks and decided none of the entrees looked appealing enough to pay about  28 bucks plus for, so we shared appetizers. we waited about 15 minutes for our drink. when we finally received our food at about 9 45 it was nothing special. to top it all off even i got the bill and they charged me for an entree i didn't even order. there are too many options in the area to go back for a mediore experince."
4,"my girlfriend took me here for my birthday what a surprise! i had their fresh oysters which were incredible tasted like they were fresh out of the ocean. what i loved the most here was their own homemade olive oil, simply the best olive oil i have tried i can just sit there the whole day having their freshly baked baguettes dipping in their basalmic vinegar and olive oil. 

glad my girlfriend showed me this little place book a reservation today you wont regret it!"
5,"my partner and i went to table 17 for dinner while on a visit to toronto, we both felt that this was a very good restaurant based on both food and service.

our hotel was in the financial center, so we wanted to explore a different part of toronto, and the server at another restaurant said good things about table 17. the atmosphere there is rather romantic, with candlelight and a somewhat dark setting. it's not a very large restaurant, but the small space doesn't make it too loud.

the menu we had was prix fixe with an appetizer, entr  e, and dessert. since there were two of us, we were able to try a good portion of the menu, and we were rather impressed with what we got. my pork belly entree was very tasty and light.  my partner had the steak frites for entr  e, and i while normally tend to stay away from steaks at a non steakhouse (because you never know what you're going to get), this steak was tender, charred, and very well executed.

the service was definitely a bright spot here. our waitresses very friendly and indulged all are crazy questions and requests.

overall, i would definitely recommend table 17 for either a group dinner or romantic dinner. there's one table right by the window that was open when we arrived, and we asked to sit there but the hostess said that people reserve some tables by number because they're good. if you care, that one is ...table 23.  )"
1,"they are changing their complex name to mosaic, so be forewarned the issues will exist there, too.

i am sick of this. the water to my apartment has just been shut off 3 times in 3 months. the first time, the guy doing their renovations cut a line, the they had a scheduled outage that resulted in dirt in my lines, and now i wake up and there is no water and i can't get a hold of anyone at the leasing office or maintenance to ask if it will be on in time for me to shower before work!

also, there is a line that drips from behind my washing machine to an open pipe and no one has ever come by to fix it after complaining to the front office. they also can't keep the walkway light by my apartment stairs lit, and i come home from work after it is dark. since i come home after dark, i notice that it seems like the gates get stuck open pretty frequently.

the new management company also doesn't believe in posting how much you owe before it is past due. you can either set up an auto withdrawal or risk they won't have it up before you are late."
4,"definitely an upscale shopping center.
the shops boutiques are definitely for the rich.  )

great shopping experience."
2,"some great shops, but crazy hard to get your bearings, find the store you're looking for, or keep track of which ""aisles"" you've ""done"" and what's left to shop... for a sport shopper like me, that's incredibly annoying   and tends to keep me away. given almost all of these stores can be found in at least one other shopping center in vegas..."
5,"three words for you...high end expensive. 

i can't give the shoppes at the palazzo any less than 5 stars because they market, advertise, and sell money.  that's their main goal.  put a bunch of high end stores together and make money.  since they accomplish their goal, you can't fault them for it.  when it comes to expensive goodies, might as well set it up correctly and at one of the more classier casinos like the palazzo.  all the stores are maintained, clean, and have some of the best service ever, like ever.  

i've only been here a half dozen times and never bought anything due to my wine taste beer budget.  but i can tell you one thing, you're never stereotyped here, you're never treated like you don't belong, and you're never more than a minute in a store without great service.  my issue...i just can't justify some of the expenses.  if i ever hit the ca lottery (2, 23, 45, 55, 8, mega 13) then you may finally find me here not window shopping, but actually getting something. 

the shoppes at the palazzo   "
4,"te cafe has an extensive selection of teas including dozens of green and black teas as well as a few other variations  you can also order coffee, hot chocolate, and pastries. in terms of ambiance, it is one of the coziest establishments that i have been in making it an ideal place to read, study, or complete some work. it's also a nice venue to meet up with a friend for a pot of tea and some quiet conversation. there are also some board games (including chess, backgammon, and dominoes among several others)"
5,"went here with my girlfriend and really enjoyed this place. great atmosphere. i'm not that into tea, but i had a couple cups from the pot my gf ordered and enjoyed it. we ordered 2 biscotti, a medium coffee and a pot of tea (which comes with a free refill) and it cost just over  7. the barista was really nice and helpful."
1,"i came in for the first time, sat down to setup my computer, and within 2 minutes had a server telling me that if i do not order anything i will have to leave. i'm not sure if i was being judged by the way i looked (wearing sweatpants and ratty t shirt), or if this is standard practice. i was planning on staying and purchasing a drink, but found this treatment extremely rude and uncomfortable. do not plan on returning."
4,"aw, i love it. it looks like a really great study area. i would come here to study. also they give you a pot of tea with free hot water refills. that would be perfect for studying. also, the guy working there was really helpful with suggestions. and the place inside is just super chill."
4,"i've been shopping at this mall since i was a child and in the last couple years they've really outdone themselves by doing a total makeover and renovation. the whole interior is a lot more trendy and reflective of our times and the big name brands and boutiques that have settled in the mail.
everything is a glossy white marble, clean and sleek.  lots of natural sunlight coming from glass rooftop openings. the food court is also impressive, they've expanded the seating area by shutting down one of the stores on the side. color combination and lighting makes this place a whole lot more appealing.

since the building of the dix 30 mega outdoor shopping lifestyle complex, mail champlain has had to renew itself to retain shoppers. the opening of the forever 21 store was one of their best moves. they also appeal to a higher class of shoppers with big brands like bcbg and browns shoes. even the bay has undergone a slight revamp   on the main floor, they've rearranged their handbag and shoe department to make way for name brands.

i used to see mostly elderly people wandering around during the week, it didn't seem like a popular hangout place for youngings but that has changed.

mail champlain has a bit of everything for all ages, tastes and budgets. the only thing missing might be a pharmacy, they used to have a jean coutu but it closed down."
3,"menu is short. excellent black bean veggie burger and seasoned waffle fries.  old fashioneds are made from scratch muddled.  i had excellent service while there  nice, competent bartender came outside to refill drinks several times.  it was a comfortable experience, relaxing outside watching the waves.  veggie people beware taxidermied animals inside."
4,"i'm very surprised to read all the negative reviews. we were made to feel very welcome as soon as we sat at the bar by tim the bartender. he was unfailingly polite and friendly, as were the people who sat near us. it made me wish we had more time to hang out and soak up the lovely waterfront location. 

starving, we ordered a pizza and both enjoyed enjoyed the hell out of it. the toppings tasted very fresh and the crust had a slight flakiness to it. the only drawbacks i can think of are the plastic cups the beer is served in and that i'd love it if another taphandle were devoted to something a bit more local to madison, like ale asylum, karben4, or even tyranena (from lake mills).

as we left tim thanked us for stopping in and asked us to come back the next time we were nearby. i 100  plan to do so."
1,"worst service ever. we arrived at 7 pm on a friday night. since it's on the lake, were not surprised there was a wait, but didn't really seem to be enoughpeople waiting for 1 1 2 hour wait.  we sat on the deck with a couple of drinks, and enjoyed that. at the 1 1 2 hour mark, went in to see how much longer and were shocked to see the mostly empty dining area in the bar. maybe the upstairs dining was busy? nope  one table of 4 waiting to be served, and 2 large tables of people who had finished eating and were doing their party speeches. we think they just forgot us.
brief wait for the waitress.10 minutes later got our salads for 2 of us, soup for 2  (husband wanted cole slaw, but they were out). soup was good. salad was very small, with a huge carrot 'coin' and cucumber slice. italian dressing was blah, bleu cheese dressing had no bleu cheese chunks.
30 minutes later, caught the attention of our oblivious waitress to check on the status of our order, and her comment was ""didn't they tell you it would be an hour wait?"" wouldn't that be the waitress' job? after another 20minutes, and the 1 hour mark, i went to find a manager. bartender blew me off, so i went to find the host,who apologized, said it was coming out now, and said they ""were just catching up"". from what? the bar area dining was almost empty, and we were still one of two 4 person tables up in the big dining area.
5 minutes later, with no waitress, no food, we left. we will not be back. maybe the food is good, can't comment on that, but the aggravation is not worth it."
5,"today i had another session with les.  i was having so much pain in my foot i thought i was going to have to give up dance.  les did a combination of multiple modalities on me including lymphatic drainage, chiropractic massage, russian massage to realign my leg and foot.  i was very relaxed and even when he had to use more pressure on the reflexology, it was fine.  he diagnosed that i had a tight inner thigh muscle and he got it to release.  les is so experienced and can read your body and diagnose where your physical issues are.  i am telling all my friends about his work!"
5,"i work in a office building right around the corner from them.  the place is small, but once you find it, you'll keep coming back.  honest to god, the food is addictive.  my faves are the italian hoagie (reminds me of home back east) and the chipotle chicken sandwich.  and i also enjoy their flavored iced tea to go along with it.

staff is friendly too which makes the experience even better!

i'm a fan!"
5,"an excellent place for lunch, the food is great the service too! always friendly, never pushy, as one guy said, i like the 'tude of the lounge lady...i call it the the lunch lizard and its off the beaten path but you wont go wrong with thier specials or anything on the menu for that matter. the outside seating is nice, i try to eat here regularly...beats any chain sammich shop!"
5,"what a find!  while staying at the aloft in phoenix for business we found this on a morning walk.   

we had the breakfast burrito and a breakfast panini.  both were excellent!  the burrito was so large we agreed that it could have fed us both.

the lunch menu looked great and i would like to try some of the sandwiches.

we are here for a few more days and will eat here on monday.

if you are staying at a hotel in this area be sure to give it a try for a good quick breakfast or lunch.  you won't be disappointed."
5,amazing lunch.  fresh boars head meats. fresh bread (marble rye is awesome) and tr staff is great.  one of the best sandwiches in the phoenix area.  don't miss this place. you won't be disappointed!
5,"was in phoenix for business and discovered this friendly, wonderful  haunt  near the airport.  i had the best lunch ever    a southwestern chicken chipotle panini.  omg!  the guy behind the counter turned out to be the owner, and himself grew up in a family owned east coast deli.  

i had several expensive meals during my trip, but nothing was as tasty as my lunch lounge experience!  i made sure i had time for a breakfast stop on my way back to the airport., and was again wowed with a huge breakfast burrito, great latte and a smile   all for less than my daily nyc latte and muffin.  

my  client has never been to the lunch lounge, so next time i am in town, we have a lunch date at the best undiscovered charming cafe in phoenix!  i can't wait to share the secret!"
2,"i visited this restaurant because i got a groupon now deal. when i walked in and the older woman standing there took about 5 minutes to acknowledge that i was standing there at the counter waiting to be served..

finally she said ""whenever your ready.."". i told her hi how are you, giving her a nice reminder that that is how your supposed to greet new customers in your establishment. that on its own turned me off because i hate giving my money away tobusinesses that don't appreciate me.  i don't feel like i am asking for much in exchange for coming back and supporting local businesses. 

as i was standing waiting for my food i overheard the employees (including my o so pleasnt serve lady) complaining about the groupons that kept coming in.. while i was standing there! rude! 

the older man behind the counter making sandwiches was very nice. he is the only reason i am giving two stars. 

the food on the other hand was decent. too bad i won't ever becoming back just to be treated like i am bothering them.. next time i will just eat mcdonalds breakfast like i wanted anyways."
3,"this is a nice spot for some of your caribbean needs.  you should definitely check it out at least once if you find yourself in the university area.

it's small and tucked away in the shopping center, but you visibly see the sign for the place.  the menu isn't that big, so you for sure will not be overwhelmed with too many choices.  i have gone here twice now and definitely recommend the goat curry or the oxtail meal.  i don't know about you, but when i ordered these, i also asked for extra gravy.  it was great to have the extra gravy with the rice and cabbage. note that when you order the meal, it doesn't come with a drink though.  kinda a bummer on that part. 

the place is alright, pretty small.  they have tables near the register, and also near the back.  i haven't been towards the back to see how many tables there are as i have only gotten take out.  the prices are a little pricey to me, but the food was worth it."
4,"food is great.  the service is average.  the prices are cheap so you tend to get idiots in there who have no manners.  i recommend, taking the food to go or sitting in the back."
5,"dont sleep on this spot! consistently great, authentic mexican food. we've tried many other places but continue to return here!"
2,"been here a couple of times and it was ok for most part. not spectacular. the food has been ok, but we've always had good service. returned last week with baby in tow, only to find no changing table in bathroom of this ""family"" friendly restaurant. not returning."
4,"i love the manager here, he knows us for a very long time. i like their food. the servers change so often that we don't like it but still they are much better than a lot of other restaurants.  

food   4 5
service   4.5 5
management   5 5"
4,"this place serves the pure vegetarian south indian cuisine .. even though i am not a pure vegetarian, i do eat out at this restaurant sometimes when i am in a mood for a light meal .. the thing with this kinda food is that no matter how much you eat, it doesn't makes your stomach go rumbling or feel heavy .. so i guess i can go here once in a while ..
the ambience isn't that great .. some of the tables are lined up in the middle of the path and i hate sitting in this area. the service is alright, not the fastest but reasonable . everytime i've been here, i've noticed that the place is kinda crowded .. so there is a lot of noise but then if i choose to eat out then i should not complain about the noise i guess.
food is good if you are not looking for the typical spicy taste that indian food is known for. their spice level is pretty low."
1,"i will never return to this place! they made us wait for 20 minutes even though there were rows of empty tables. then when seated, again another 15 minute wait and i had to ask to be served. we had a pretty simple order 2 people, 4 items. they managed to mess it up. food took forever to come and one item was missing. when i asked for the item the wait staff denied i had ordered it their computer clearly confirmed otherwise. the manager came by and said 'sorry we can't handle the crowd.' um...you're running a restaurant with a certain number of seats. what are you doing if you can't handle the customers? and to boot they offered us a free dessert (which we didn't want) but didn't take a penny off the bill. 
the food was mediocre. stay far far away from this place. i'm sure there are better places for a dosa craving."
4,"went for saturday dinner with 4 ppl.  very friendly and knowledgeable staff.  extremely clean!!!  love the hand washing station!!!  great service and fantastic food, however only gave 4 out of 5 stars for two reasons   (1) waiter forgot to bring our lassi (yet it was charged on the bill and we had to ask for it to be removed.. oh well, not too big a deal, it was an accident), and (2) the timing of bringing our dishes.  we ordered one appetizer to share, and four entrees.  one entree came first, several minutes later the appetizer came, and then several minutes later second entree, and several several minutes later the third entree, then much later the last entree came.  it wasn't ideal for us to be eating one at a time, lol.  this is a great restaurant to try if those two things don't bug you  )"
5,"great place if you want to taste real south indian food. great customer service. the food was tasty, specially their special meal with different curries and rice. so far i have had very experience with this place after several visits."
1,today i went to sarvana bhava with my family at scarborough location this is one of the worst sevice i got i went with my infant baby (i had requested a seat in corner for my baby but the waiter was very rude he was more interested in accommodating other guest though place was relatively empty) and the service was pathetic. waited half an hour for tandoori paratha after finishing fist one and which never camei wont recommend this place for anyone
5,it's inside the mall and the food is awesome! probably the best authentic chinese dinner you can have on christmas eve in north carolina. just don't peek in the kitchen. you're all good.
4,"it helps to have someone understand the language while in the hong kong bbq, but they do have english menus that you can use on the counter.  it is pretty cheap for some good food.  just ignore the pig hanging from the ceiling if you find that gross and also ignore the food rating as i survived my visit and i am sure you will yours.  just make sure to wipe down your silverware when you get them.

personally i really liked the bbq pork which you can see hanging with all the meat in little strips  which, they cut up and serve with rice is really good."
5,i love this place! kenny is awesome! the owner is super cool and friendly. i have been coming here for 4 years and i would never go anywhere else. it's nice and clean and bright and open. i have been getting my nails done for 18 years and this is by far the best nail salon i have been to.
5,"love this nail salon. i read the reviews on yelp and decided to try.  each experience has been positive, i've been going every 2 3 weeks since march.  i generally get a pedicure and gel manicure.  i haven't had the same technician twice but i always walk out happy with my nails and toes and get loads of compliments.  

the have great selection of gel  shellac  gelish polishes, can almost always find colors that match the regular polish near perfectly. prices are good, they have different pedicure choices you can add on and different types of pedicures to encompass all their different services. 

go during the week!  their weekends are insanely busy, you will have to wait and your services are good, but much better during the week.  that being said they like to take their time during the week.  sometimes its helpful to let them know you have a bit of a time crunch.  (my last gel manicure and pedicure i was there for just over 90 minutes)  i appreciated the time and enjoyed the break, but i know sometimes that much time is too much to spare."
5,"i recently moved to this salon after 5 years somewhere else that was close by. this salon is great. great prices, very clean and great service. the techs dont sit on their phone the entire time you are there  ) i will be ditching the other salon and using this place from now on! great find. highly recommend!"
5,"first time at fancy today. walk in appointment and i got sat immediately with ha. she was very good! very clean and quick technique. the salon is very nice and welcoming...they offer coffee, water, etc. i recently moved to the area and will definitely be back!!"
4,"went on a whim while running errands and i was helped right away. the salon was very clean and the chairs comfy. the staff was friendly and though it was busy it was fairly quiet so i felt i could relax. basic mani pedi for  34, not too bad! will be visiting again!"
5,"love this salon. kim is very friendly and did a really nice job on my mani and pedi. the owner runs a very tight ship and not very many people are talking, it's very quiet, the staff are very attentive and it's very relaxing. the place is very very clean. i will make this my nail salon now, it's reasonable, friendly, clean and relaxing, what more could you want?"
4,"needed a new nail place closer to my house so went here on a whim. i went on a wed afternoon so was pretty quiet and they were able to get me in right away. pedicure was very nice, massage was long, they offered me a bottle of water, normal prices, clean place, and friendly staff. my only complaint was they didn't have me sit under the lamp to dry so after i got home i noticed one if my toes was smeared. luckily i brought my own polish so i could touch it up. i will be going here again."
5,thank you yelpers!! i found also found this place to be awesome!! clean and lots of gel colors and glitter to choose from. ill be back there for sure!!
2,"my gf and i ate at fin's on saturday night sept 21, 2013.  we had the chef's special tasting box which had 9 different items. the honey topped eggplant was quite good but everything else was mundane at best.  there were rubbery little pieces of octopus with much chopped vegetables in a sauce that overwhelmed everything. there was spicy salmon which was not spicy and was overwhelmed by a massive amount of mayo.  the tuna was tasteless. etc. in addition, the decor is primitive and the place is incredibly loud for a supposedly upscale restaurant. it is simply not a good restaurant and i would not return."
4,"what a gem! i'm so happy i wandered into fin! 

since moving to oakville i've been searching for as many toronto esque restaurants as possible so i can get my fill! i've found a few great places there, but no food (especially asian) has actually been that great   until fin! 

i went here on a sunday evening, and was concerned it wouldn't be open, but it was until 10 pm. we were greeted in japanese and seated immediately by our extremely friendly and attentive server. 

food is a bit on the pricey side, but without there being much competition in terms of izakaya in oakville, i wasn't surprised, and it didn't break the bank. 

personal favorites were the selection of fish for three (see picture, so beautiful!) and the eastern style caesar (who wouldn't love a drink with a crab leg in it!).

overall i was super impressed with the quality and variety of food, as well as the service. i couldn't recommend fin enough to those starved for a bit of asian food in oakville!

disclaimer  if you're from toronto and eat izakaya all the time, this might be a touch pricey for you!"
4,"exceeded expectations. ate early around 6.15 pm so was fairly quiet...2 others. strangely asked if we had reservations...interesting! 
sauvignon blanc from chile was good and can be recommended. cucumber addiction tasty, avocado tempura very good, sashimi 3 kinds flawless, fresh raspberry point fresh oysters excellent value at  1.50 each. shichimi duck salad also very good.  at  76 before hst   tip about right for the quality. pleasant staff....will go again!"
4,"fairly new establishment on the lakeshore strip in downtown oakville.  a good thing to see with all the for lease signs that have been cropping up lately.

if someone could translate what is yelled at patrons once they enter, it would be greatly appreciated.  i'll assume it is a greeting.  the friendly staff that helped us explained that the general restaurant experience is that of arriving, eating and then leaving to go enjoy something else, somewhere else.  the izakaya experience is designed for you to eat, drink, socialize, etc. all under one roof.  hence the loud and sometimes frantic atmosphere.  pretty much a tapas menu.

after perusing the sake menu, my wife and i settled on some sapporo, mine in the bath sized glass.  it wasn't that the sake menu wasn't impressive, but my wife doesn't love it, i have limited experience with the gekkeikan brand and i just wasn't in the mood to take a chance on a 3 oz,  15 30 sake that i may or may not like.  maybe if i'd have been encouraged or had some sort of crash course i would have considered.

any way, food 

in absence of a bread basket, you are given what is called thin spaghetti, coated in salt and flavoured with a spicy curry.  a little strange a different as it is like eating spicy uncooked spaghetti.  

started with the cucumber addiction   sliced pickled cucumber with sesame seed and oil.  a great clean tasting starter.  all orders come out fast and furious, but staggered so as not to bung up the table too much.

the pork rib kakuni was really good.  3 fall off the bone pork ribs that are slow braised and served on mashed potato with a spicy mustard for more flavour.  this was really tasty and a good portion of meat for only 3 pork ribs.

the soy bean cream crab croquette is a mouthful.  resembling arancini balls, but stuffed with crab, there 3 little guys are filling and have more substance to them than your average crab dish.

the tuna carpaccio is delicious with a savoury mixture coating the fish.  a little tricky to pick up with the chop sticks, as it is chopped rather finely, but worth the effort.

the deep fried prawns are quite massive and heavy on the garlic, but the spicy sauce make 'em quite a lovely plate and pretty to look at once delivered.

as the evening progresses, more and more residents of oakville filter in.  there is a lot of bumping and jockeying for room in this narrow little space.  conversations can be heard from basically every table.  the fake chested table were amazed when barbie's shorter sister came in, no less than one month after giving birth and back to her fighting weight.  a quick cat walk, a twirl and they're sat beside us.  yaaaaay.

this is where service fell apart.  we had one more order coming and we were contemplating another round of drinks and possibly dessert.  but with all the air kissing going on and the place getting louder and packed, the person taking our orders came back to our table after 15 20 minutes, stating that he'd forgotten to enter our last dish.  another 20 minutes later and the special of the night cod we'd ordered arrived.  it was incredible and naturally buttery.  any aggressive thoughts were forgotten instantaneously.


food for thought   if you come for the special catches of the day, come early.  4 of the 6 fish specials were sold out by 7 30.  and the blowtorch mackerel?  it may be delicious but smells of burnt arm hair.  maybe its just me and my wacky palette.

hopefully the ""trendiness"" wears off in the passing months.  the food is quite good and staff are helpful, sincere and very knowledgeable with the menu.  it is the clientelle that i could do without."
4,"we had a light dinner here, it was fantastic! fresh seafood at it's finest. started out with arran smoked salmon with potato scones, cr  me fra  che and chives, the salmon was so fresh, it melted in your mouth. we also split a kg of the scottish mussels, we chose shallots, white wine, garlic   cream sauce, don't forget to order some bread to dip into the pot and soak up the goodness. this was probably one of the best mussels pots i've had. 

call and make a reservation if you can, we waited 45 minutes for a table (we went over to the bow bar to pass the time). if you can, sit outside, great people watching, right in the heart of grassmarket."
5,"the best surf and turf i have ever had. 

i stumbled upon this place by accident during a day trip to edinburgh. it was during scotland's unexpected (and sorely missed) heatwave so we sat outside   a rare treat in our climate. we were the first diners when we sat down but by the time we left the place was full and there was a great vibe. 

now to the food. me and my dad both opted for the same thing   the surf and turf. this consists of a rib eye steak served with half a kilogram of mussels cooked in your choice of sauce, crevettes and squid rings. being a big fan of asian flavours i opted for the chilli, ginger and lime sauce. we also ordered some buttered new potatoes on the side to add some carbohydrate to all the protein.

when the dish arrived it was amazing. perfectly cooked steak (medium rare for me) sitting on a mountain of seafood   not many things could look so appealing. all the seafood was full of flavour, the sauce had just enough heat and the corona with lime just added to an amazing meal.

next time i'm in edinburgh i will definitely be making a return here (i hope the heatwave will too)."
3,"was expecting a lot from this place based on the reviews, but honestly we didnt love it. it was just ok. service was quick and friendly. they were also happy to oblige my dairy intolerance, which was nice. both the seafood and steak were good quality, but i guess they were just a bit boring. 

boyfriend wasnt so keen on the strange warm, limp cabbage on the side of the steak. although the steak was cooked as ordered (medium rare) which was good. the queen scallop starter was ok, but the scallops were quite small and over salted. mussels were pretty good. 

overall a decent meal, but not good enough to get us over to grassmarket on a regular basis."
5,"i don't like mussels.  they are too strong and too fishy! don't care for the smell and don't care for them in soups or stews.  until now i would have told you that i'd rather eat rattlesnake.  appearantly in scottland, there is an entirely different species of mussels.

we stopped in at the mussel and steak bar for dinner before walking up to the castle for the 10 30 tattoo.  our travel mate ordered the mussel starter.  it arrived with green sauce on it.  omg, it smelled amazing.  so much so that i had to taste it.  the little mussels were tender and steamed to perfection with a light pesto sauce driselled over them.  it is such a great combination!

i had the surf and turf for dinner.  the mussels were done in white wine and garlic and the ribeye steak was tender, juicey and cooked exactly as i ordered it. all four of us agreed that our meals were delightful.  the price was not out of line.  service was spot on."
4,"i went here recently for a colleague's leaving lunch. there were 8 of us in our group   it was quite busy. 

we ordered from the lunch menu   1 course   7.95, 2 courses   9.95 or 3 courses   11.95.

most of the group ordered starters   the haggis dish was the most popular. 

i saved myself for the 6oz rump steak which was awesome. the chips were chunky   crispy, just how i like them   the mushrooms were earthy   full of flavour. my steak was perfectly cooked, moist   melt in the mouth. 

a colleague had the seafood curry. it was full of enormous mussels   other fishy delights. it smelled amazing   he said it was the best fish curry he's had. the only problem being that it took so long to arrive he didn't have time to finish it before having to get back to work.

unfortunately the service was slow and i we all had to skip dessert   coffee as we needed to get back to the office (despite being there over 90 mins).

a lovely lunch with great food   company. it was a shame the slow service meant it was a wee bit stressful. the front of house staff were lovely maybe they just need another pair of hands in the kitchen."
4,"fantastic location but very small on the inside, can be a long wait.  the seafood was only slightly above average in freshness and quality, and small portions, so had to knock off one star."
4,"i never fail to enjoy a good feed at the mussel and steak bar. pot of mussels with white wine and garlic sauce does the job perfectly. the ambience is pleasant, but it's better to sit downstairs as the upstairs bit feels a bit empty and lonely i think. 

food is generally lovely. staff are generally lovely. place is generally lovely. go!"
3,"definitely not the classiest joint in town... or maybe it is...?

the tables are old(er) but the felt is still in relatively good shape. some of the cues have cracked tips but if you look, you can usually find one worth playing with. 

monday and tuesdays they have  5 pool from 6pm to 11pm (although i think that's gone up to  6 recently)... either way, you can't complain about that. 

they have a fully stocked bar and will make tea and coffee on request for those of us who don't drink. they also have a half decent menu with food that's prepared downstairs at texas burger (yum).  

you're pretty much in view of a tv wherever you are and they have a large projection tv in the lounge area allowing you to sit, eat and watch the game. 

i'm not saying it doesn't happen but i've never seen a rowdy crowd here and although i've been to better halls, this place is okay for a fun night out."
5,"thank you, finally an audio   video specialist company you can trust and thats not creepy. i was't even planning on putting a home theater system for my house until i talked to jeremy, who was highly recommended by a close friend. long story short he stopped by my house we did a walk through together and he really took his time to explain the different possible options we had based on quality of the products and my budget. he wasn't pushy and made me feel real comfortable. next day i received an amazingly priced estimate and decided i was going to do it. him and an associate of his stopped by on the date we agreed on (on time) and knocked my whole home theater system out in less than 5 hours. what made my experience even better was the fact that he was more than willing to teach me how to use my brand new pioneer receiver. all and all they made my life a lot  more entertaining. i have to admit i did spent a bit more than i had initially planned but it was worth it. i will be calling them back for more stuff, highly a    recommended..."
5,"i have worked with jeremy at elite a v numerous times he is very particular clean and does excellent work. they do everything at 100 , never cut corners, very knowledgeable, polite, and honest. i recommend them to anyone!!"
5,"jeremy is a great worker, very knowledgable and honest. such quality work for the price too! i highly recommend elite av."
2,"wished it was better..
after watching man vs. food i decided to stop by, d  cor was not that homey and welcoming, and the neighborhood was bad, but nothing i haven't been around before.  the ribs were very fatty and grisly, it was disappointing and i didn't get enough sauce and when i asked for a little more they wanted to charge me, the coleslaw was awesome!  i noticed a hair in my food and it turned me off to the rest of it, so i threw it away , i wont be returning...
sorry guys"
2,"i've been going to hot sauce williams for the past 15 years and this place is going down hill big time!  the service continues to get worse and the attitude of the workers is piss poor.  they ignore you and can be very rude as well.  also, the place is very dirty and i would love to see the health inspection report.  

i will admit there sauce is some of the best i have ever had.  the wings are just not as good as they used too, but the polish boy is still very good.  the mac n cheese is very overrated and do not order the ribs.  they are like chowing down on a gristled piece of fat and that has the texture of rubber.  my friend tossed them away they were so bad.  

very sad to see an cleveland institution goes down the tubes like this and hope they can improve but that's the last they have seen of my business.  

p.s don't even bother going through the drive thru unless you have 20 mins to spare, no joke."
4,"i have been going here for at long time and its one of few places i can overlook bad service because i love the food. the wings are great, best wings in cleveland but the best offering from here is the barbeque sauce. better service and it would be 5 stars."
4,"i know others have been moaning about their service, but our experience last sunday was great. 

we were disappointed about the dining room being closed, but the drive through was open and the staff were very patient with our endless debate about what to order (our son can be finicky). they even chimed in with recommendations when they told us that fried okra was unavailable.

the food was incredible    and really messy in the car as we scarfed it down on our way back to nyc. we had polish girls, mac and cheese, black eyed peas and a pork shoulder sandwich. the sauce is really special. 

we strongly recommend it to everyone. great food, great service, really cheap."
5,"forget about the place and service (which were fine) and let's talk about the food!  the polish boy was good, but the fried chicken was amazing!!  and the sauce was killer!"
4,"hot sauce williams is definitely a guilty pleasure of mine  ) my favorite dish from here is the fried chicken and ribs dinner. for sides, i get the sweet potato fries and mac and cheese. they give you sooooo much food for just under  12! 

the servers work only behind the food stand, so you pretty much have to clean off the tables yourself. you may at first be deterred from this place by its lack of cleanliness, but the food is so worth it!  one thing to keep in mind, they don't provide free water, but a bottle of water is only  1. 

definitely worth checking out!"
3,"all the shoppes at the palazzo are expensive. this is like the rodeo dr of california or oak street in the gold coast of chicago. it is not like at ceasar's forum shops where there is a lot more variety. 
i like to window shop here and wish for things i can not afford, but the sales people are very pleasant here. 
they offered water bottles while i shopped at tory burch's for a specific purse my daughter was raving about.
  also important to mention is i was almost swindled into buying some ""sea salt"" cosmetics from la savon. it's nothing more than the other cosmetics sold in kiosks throughout las vegas and elsewhere...i was curious how they managed to have an actual store front shop. the woman there tried to sell me 2 bottles of makeup first for  599, then went to  199 in a matter of minutes to get a sale. i flew out of there as quick as i could. thankfully my husband made some excuse to leave."
5,another one of my favorite places to shop in vegas. i love the huge victoria's secret!!! could spend entire day shopping here!
4,this gorgeous mall of shoppes in the venetian hotel in las vegas are pricey for sure but it's lovely to look at all the upscale items. there are a few shops here and there that won't break your bank   look for basin (a great little soap shop that has only one other location and that's in orlando) and fresh (great cosmetics) and other beauty stores. lovely restaurants and super clean throughout.
4,"on a couple of occasions, we strolled through the shoppes at the palazzo.  the assortment of high end brands was satisfactory, but it was not all inclusive.  for chanel, lv, or other high end stores, you have to go across the street to the mall.  the shoppes at the palazzo is well decorated with marble floors and other fine textures.  if you do not like to gamble and have the means to shop at high end stores, this place is for you.  as a result, we usually stick to the slot machines!"
4,"lovely lovely lovely. i spent some time at the tory burch store. bought some darling flats and nearly broke out into a huge sweat. man its hot in there. no air circulation at all. next was the michael kors store again. this store is much smaller than the one at the forum. huge burberry store with clothes, bags, shoes, scarves, everything. great selection. the chlo   store was amazing as well.  but let me tell you what did it for me was the christian louboutin store. beautiful selection. this mall is next to the canal where all the gondolas are. lovely area. the only thing was the floor plans of the stores were a little weird to follow."
